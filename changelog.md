### v0.pre.3
- shutdown key combo (esc + sound button)
- save on shutdown, load on startup
- pattern length parameter - patterns can now be between 1-64 steps, per sound
- changed the way knob values update (now just need to move them some to input, rather than past the current value)
- pattern page edit (to access steps 17-64 of each pattern)

### v0.pre.2
- brighter write light
- when in "live write" mode, the play light shows in red
- new "clear pattern" action (hold escape and pattern together)
- displays "copy pattern" when doing the copy pattern action
- better screen output (shows pattern and sound as much as possible)
- current pattern & current sound shown when selecting pattern and sound
